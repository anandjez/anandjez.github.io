About me
======
I am a recent MTech. graduate in Signal Processing from Electrical Engineering department at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I currently work with Dr. Cl\'ement Canonne (University of Sydney). I am broadly interested in the theoretical aspects of statistical inference. I did my master's thesis on Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms under the guidance of Pof. Navin Kashyap. You can find my CV here.
